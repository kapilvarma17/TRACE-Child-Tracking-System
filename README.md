# TRACE Child Tracking System

Child kidnapping and trafficking incidents are increasing day 
by day and there is no efficient way for the parents to know 
when their children reach and leave the institution. 
To resolve this, we have implemented an RFID, GPS-GSM,
Raspberry Pi and Android App based tracking system where in the
parents, as well as teachers, will be able to identify the
student’s location, entry, and exit to and from the school as
well as while on the bus.

The hardware connections include two parts: the bus unit and the school unit. 

For the 
Bus Unit, Raspbeery Pi is connected to the GPS-GSM Module for real-time location
of the bus. In the School Unit, Raspberry Pi is connected to the RFID Reader where it
will read the student tag and send the entry-exit time to the server.

The Primary objective of this project is to help and enable the parents/users to track their child’s location efficiently with an economical solution.
The parents will be notified when the child has entered/exited the school premises as well as the school bus.
The parents will also be able to view the current location of the bus on the map while it is in transit.

Note: The project document will be added soon.
